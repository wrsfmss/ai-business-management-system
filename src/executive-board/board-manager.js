**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION**: [Proceed/Proceed with Modifications/Defer/Reject] with the proposed decision

**RATIONALE**: 
- Strategic alignment with business objectives
- Positive risk-adjusted financial impact
- Feasible implementation with available resources
- Acceptable risk profile with appropriate mitigation
- Positive stakeholder impact overall

## Consensus Strength
- **Board Alignment**: 85-95% consensus among board members
